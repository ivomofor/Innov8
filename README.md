I bootstrap this app with Create-React-App.

This React App uses an artificial API-data which I created and saved it on mongoDB server.

It fetches the data from backend server and renders it on the client side. 

I also added a button to add in new game records but the numbers of teams added cannot be above 16.  

I am a Junior Web Developer with not professional work experience.
